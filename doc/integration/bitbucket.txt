Bitbucket integration
=====================

It's possible to connect bitbucket to deploy-commander and automate some deployment tasks.

We use the git flow by default for automated builds.
See `a successful git branching model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model>`_


How it works
------------

Bitbucket has a post pull request hook that will post information when pull and merge requests are executed. We have exposed a rest endpoint that can catch this post request.

Setup and start the webserver (:doc:`See the usage <usage>`, and :doc:`config <config>`)

::

	$ deploy-commander runserver

By default it will listen to the merge action from bitbucket. So when somebody merges code in the develop branch it will execute : 

::

	$ deploy-commander go:<project>,testing run:deploy-app

When somebody merges code into the release branch it will execute:

::
	
	$ deploy-commander go:<project>,staging run:deploy-app


.. note:: Still in beta now.. we'll update as much as possible.


Setup Bitbucket hook
--------------------

Go to your webadmin https://bitbucket.org repo. Under settings -> webhooks you'll find 
add webhook. 

Select a trigger (pull request->merged) and enter your deploy-commander rest endpoint:
